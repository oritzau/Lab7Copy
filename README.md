Command to copy this, assuming your lab 7 is in /students/shared/YOURID/cs276-IndividualLabWork/Lab07-DoctorSearch:

`git clone https://github.com/oritzau/Lab7Copy.git`

`rm -rf /students/shared/YOURID/cs276-IndividualLabWork/Lab07-DoctorSearch`

`mv Lab7Copy /students/shared/YOURID/cs276-IndividualLabWork/Lab07-DoctorSearch`

Questions:
23. No, the attacks do not work against the updated application.
24. Maybe slightly? Having to track which index values should be placed into can be somewhat tedious, but java string operations are usually painstaking either way so I would not consider it strictly harder to use.
25. I think that the focus on rapid growth forced onto workers by a shareholder-centric economy causes people to frequently discard safety and verification in the name of progress and faster development time. If the focus in business shifted from delivering as quickly as possible to as securely as possible, SQL injection attacks would likely drop significantly.
